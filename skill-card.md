### License/Terms of Use: <br>


## Use Case: <br>
External users and developers use this skill to let an agent search, list, upload, download, and manage metadata in a Paperless-ngx document archive through the Paperless REST API. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: The Paperless-ngx token can allow an agent to read documents, upload files, and create or modify archive metadata. <br>
Mitigation: Use a least-privilege Paperless account and review agent actions before running commands that change the archive. <br>
Risk: Connections to remote Paperless-ngx instances may expose sensitive document data or tokens if sent over insecure transport. <br>
Mitigation: Prefer HTTPS for remote Paperless-ngx instances and protect PAPERLESS_TOKEN as a secret. <br>
Risk: Downloads write document files to a local path chosen by the command. <br>
Mitigation: Pass a safe --output path when downloading and review the destination before execution. <br>
Risk: Advanced direct API operations can update, delete, or bulk-edit documents and metadata. <br>
Mitigation: Require explicit user approval before any advanced update, delete, or bulk operation. <br>
